        <h2>Ingrediates</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 pounds pork shoulder, cut into a 2-inch chunks</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves minced garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 cup apple cider or apple juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon prepared horseardish</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chicken broth or more as needed </li>
            <li>4 Sage leaves</li>
            <li>2 sprigs thyme</li>
            <li>2 small sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>1 dried bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced carrots</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, sliced</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup green peas, fresh or frozen</li>
            <li>1/4 cup matchstick-cut apple strips</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season pork chunks generously with salt and pepper. Toss to distribute seasonings evenly</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over high heat. Brown pork in batches so meat isn't crowded, about 7 minutes per batch. Transfer pork to a plate.</li>
            <li>Place onions into the same pot; cook and stir until translucent and the edges brown, 3 or 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in apple cider and apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat to high and stir in mustard and horseradish. Transfer browned pork pieces back to the pot, along with any accumulated juices. Pour in cream and 1/4 cup chicken broth; add more chicken broth to cover if needed. Add sage, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf; season with a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer, then cover and simmer over low heat for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add carrots, celery, and cayenne pepper; season with more black pepper. Leave uncovered and simmer until meat is tender, about 1 hour. Add peas and simmer for 10 minutes. (Optional: for a thicker sauce, raise heat and simmer until sauce is reduced, 5 to 8 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Garnish individual servings with apple strips and chives.</li>
